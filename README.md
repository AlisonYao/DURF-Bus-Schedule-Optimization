# DURF-Bus-Schedule-Optimization

Building on our [final project](https://github.com/AlisonYao/Optimization-Final-Project) for the course Intro to Optimization and Mathematical Programming, we further extended our problem settings to be closer to real-life scenarios. We used Genetic Algorithm to further optimized the NYU Shanghai shuttle bus schedules.

Special thanks to Professor Zhibin Chen, the supervisor of this research project, for offering us guidance along the way and Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund (DURF) for generously providing us research funding.
